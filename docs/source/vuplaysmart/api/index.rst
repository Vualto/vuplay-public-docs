API DOCUMENTATION
=================

.. Hint:: The vuplay smart javascript will attach a `Vuplay` namespace to the window. All access to the vuplay smart objects, methods and loaded players should be through this namespace or instantiated classes from the `Vuplay` namespace. If anything is interacted with in another way it could cause abnormal behaviour.

You will find on the left sidebar the navigation menu through the `Vuplay` object.
